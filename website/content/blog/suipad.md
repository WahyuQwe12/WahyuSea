SuiPad is the first IDO & INO platform built on top of Sui, the first permissionless Layer 1 blockchain serving the next billion users on web3. We aim to bring you the next blue chip on Sui.SuiPad will introduce decentralized fundraising, $SUIP token staking, and voting governance to the Sui ecosystem.   The SuiPad platform will be a complete solution for SuiPad, with integrated wallet, DEX and transaction management. All major Sui wallets will be supported. This platform will extend any wallet connected with inline wallet management. Users do not need to leave the platform to view token balances, send or receive tokens or manage token accounts. Experienced users can still manage their wallet through their wallet provider, and any changes will be reflected on the platform immediately.

sSuiPad is the first decentralized launchpad on the Sui Network. With Sui building the safest and most scalable Layer 1 blockchain for its next billion users, SuiPad was engineered from the ground up to empower Sui project owners (both Token & NFT), by offering a personalized token launch experience with a customized launch model, time period , types of tokens accepted, and the auction algorithm. SuiPad is only successful if our launchpad project is successful.

Token distribution Our seed and private sale rounds are distributed to many different participants. By distributing our seeds, private and public sales, we are trying to create the fairest distribution of tokens at launch possible without a single entity holding a large supply.

Decentralization and Community are key drivers of the Web 3.0 economy, and with SuiPad's proprietary launch model, we've combined tier- and lottery-based allocation to ensure fair prize distribution to all token holders. Nonetheless, we also understand that participating in a launchpad IDO is a high risk - high reward activity so we are holding an escrow for project funds to protect investors' primary capital.

The tokens in the round called Initial DEX Offering (IDO) will be issued in a fully autonomous and decentralized manner through the use of smart contracts. With SuiPad, NFT tokens or projects will be able to increase liquidity cheaply and quickly. Users will be able to participate in a safe and risk-adjusted environment, as well as boost the next wave of crypto projects on the Sui Network.
